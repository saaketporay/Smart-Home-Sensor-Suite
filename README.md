# Smart-Home-Sensor-Suite

## Inspiration
I wanted to make a project to analyze the temperature and humidity in my home garden. Having sensor data could help me correlate how the humidity and temperature affects plants. I also grill and needed something that can alert me to an excess of carbon monoxide or combustible gas.

## What it does
It analyzes the temperature and humidity. Also alerts me to an excess of Carbon Monoxide and Combustible Gas 

## How we built it
Used Arduino and various sensors to build it. MQ-5, MQ-7 and DHT-11 Module

## Challenges we ran into
I had issues working with the libraries at first but figured it out.

## What's next for Smart Home Sensor Suite
Add Bluetooth connectivity and create a 3D printed enclosure
